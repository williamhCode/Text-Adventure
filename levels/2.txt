-DANCE FLOOR
As the elevator opens begins to slow down you start to hear music and as the elevator doors open your eyes are suddenly assaulted by a wave of neon colors and flashing lights, as you exit the elevator you notice throngs of people dancing and enjoying themselves. This place was definitely not here before. You see a DJ up on stage and two groups of people in the corners of the room, as well as a door with a VIP written in golden letters above it.
1DJ
"What sorry I cant hear you if you want to request a song we have a machine for that over there", the DJ says this as he points towards the left corner.
4Vip Door
It is a solid looking door with the letters VIP above there also seems to be a letter hatch on the door.
The door doesn't budge.
As you put the golden ticket into the hatch you here the sound of gears whirring as the door opens.
You don't have anything that would fit in the hatch.

-RIGHT CORNER
As you examine the right corner of the room you notice a shady looking guy leaning against the far wall with most of his body covered in a black cloak you also see a small group of people sitting around a table playing some sort of card game.
3Gamblers
As you approach the card players you realize that there gambling as they have a collection of poker chips on the table you can also begin to be able here them over the music "do you have any full houses" "uno" "you fool you've activated my trap card" you have no idea what game there playing. But you also notice one of the gamblers flip a golden coin into the air.
"You want this little thing" one of the gamblers says "Ok you can have it but I want something first, the music here sucks" "here" one of the other players say as he hands you a USB drive "the music we want is on here, so see if you can find a way to play it"
"You really kept us waiting huh?" the gambler says with a smirk. "Well a deals a deal heres one golden coin for you", the gambler with the coin flips it one more time as you see it glitch, vanish and suddenly appear in your hand.
1Golden Coin
A single golden coin roughly the size of a poker chip the coin occasionally flashes purple and white as it glitches out hopefully that shady guy wont care
2Shady Guy
The mysterious figure notices your approach as a slight smirk begins to form on his face "why it's my favorite customer what do you wish to buy today" the man open up his cloak to reveal a collection of VIP tickets "one golden ticket one golden coin you know the rules"
"Thank you for your patronage my friend" the shady man says as he hands you one of his tickets "Now I should get going, I have a friend of mine who needs help with a zombie problem", the man says as he walks away into the crowd of people dancing and disappear.

-LEFT CORNER
The left corner if the room seems to be the same as the main floor with groups of people dancing the only other thing you notice is some sort of device in one of the walls
5Music Wueue
as you approach the device it shines a bright blue as it turns on and a large enter password appears across the screen as four arrows appear on the screen as well as eight circles   
the screen flashes red and resets
the Screen flashes green as one of the circles turn green
the Screen flashes green as the picture of a USB port appears on the screen
as soon as you press the USB to the screen it disapears and a new song starts being played

-VIP ROOM
As you enter the room the door slams shut behind you and the music from the dance floor suddenly goes quiet, the room you're in looks to be some kind of lounge with some couches a table and more weirdly, no one else besides you seems to be with you. You also notice an elevator on the opposite side of the room from where you enter.
4Elevator
As you approach the elevator there is only one button on it that says exit and a spot to put a key.
Nothing happens.
The key fits perfectly and as you turn the button lights up yellow.
The button turns green as the elevator stutters and opens.
1Table
It's a normal table but you see a note stuck to it
1Note
As you pick up the note it seems to be unreadable, but the marking on it begin to change and move. Soon it becomes legible and the note says "If you're reading this you need to leave. Something trapped you in this simulation, and there's a key under the coach. Quickly grab it and get out of here."
2Couch
It's a normal couch.
As you reach under the couch you can feel a metal object. As you pull it out it begins to change shape and by the time you take a good look at it, it looks like an ordinary key.
